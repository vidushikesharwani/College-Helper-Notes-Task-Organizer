# Problem Statement

College students often struggle to keep track of their notes and daily tasks, especially when managing multiple subjects, assignments, deadlines, and personal reminders. Without a proper organizing tool, tasks are forgotten, notes get scattered, and productivity decreases.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a simple and user-friendly command-line application that helps students:

-Store and manage study notes

-Organize daily tasks and deadlines

-Update, delete or view saved information easily

-Maintain data even after closing the program

-The project does not require any external database and uses regular text files to store information, making it easy for beginners to understand and use.

## Approach

The program is developed using Python by applying:

Modular programming

File handling

Menu-driven interaction

Simple console-based UI

The project is divided into multiple modules for better structure:

notes.py – functions for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing notes

tasks.py – managing tasks and updating status

app.py – the main file that connects all modules and displays the menu

## Expected Outcome

By the end of the project, users should be able to:

Maintain organized notes and tasks in one place

Improve productivity with clear tracking

Learn the basics of:

Menu-based programming

Files for persistent storage

Modular code structure in Python

Scope

This project can be expanded in the future by adding:

Deadline reminders

Priority levels

Search functionality

Export to PDF

A graphical user interface (GUI)
